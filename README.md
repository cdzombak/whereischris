[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

A quick site hacked together to let family and friends view my progress on road trips. It pulls together my location in real-time along with latest [tweets](https://twitter.com/cdzombak), [Last.fm scrobbles](http://last.fm/user/cdrom600), and [Foursquare checkins](https://foursquare.com/cdzombak/history).

## Location monitoring

â€¦is provided by a simple PHP script that receives updates from my iPhone, running [ChrisTracker](https://github.com/cdzombak/ChrisTracker), and stores them in a JSON file on the server. That file is served by nginx to the JS driving the map view.

## Other features

The map updates every 15 seconds, which is kinda neat.
